SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = """
AbletonBridge provides 345 tools for controlling Ableton Live sessions. This guidance covers cross-tool relationships, sequencing, and constraints not documented on individual tools.

## Startup

Call get_server_capabilities first in every session. It reports ableton_connected, m4l_connected, browser cache state, and tool count. If ableton_connected is false, most tools will fail.

## Compound Tools

These combine multiple operations into one call (3-5x fewer round-trips). Prefer them over manual multi-step sequences:
- create_instrument_track — track + instrument + name + color
- create_drum_track — MIDI track + Drum Rack + clip + drum pattern (8 styles)
- create_clip_with_notes — clip creation + note writing
- batch_set_mixer — volume/pan/mute/solo for multiple tracks
- apply_effect_chain — load multiple effects sequentially
- setup_send_return — return track + effect + send level mapping
- get_full_session_state — session + all tracks + returns + scenes in one query
- save_effect_chain / load_effect_chain — template system. Caveat: load restores devices only; parameters require a separate restore step.

## Track Indexing

Track indices shift after create/delete — call get_all_tracks_info to refresh. Return tracks have their own 0-based index (Send A = return 0, Send B = return 1), separate from regular tracks. The `track_type` parameter ("track", "return", "master") selects which namespace — used by set_mixer, get_device_parameters, and others. Master track has no pan parameter (silently ignored if set).

## Clips & Notes

Session clips are addressed by (track_index, clip_index) where clip_index is the slot row. Arrangement clips live on the timeline — use get_arrangement_clips to list them; create_arrangement_midi_clip (Live 12.1+) / create_arrangement_audio_clip (Live 12.2+) to create them.

A clip must exist before writing notes: create_clip first, then add_notes_to_clip — or use create_clip_with_notes. get_clip_notes with time_span=0 returns the entire clip.

add_notes_extended supports Live 11+ note properties: probability (0.0-1.0 float, NOT percentage), velocity_deviation (-127 to +127 signed).

Time values are always in beats. Session clips: beats from clip start. Arrangement clips: beats from song position 0.

## Grid Notation

For drum patterns and rhythmic content, prefer grid_to_clip (ASCII grid notation) over individual note dictionaries. Grid notation is more compact and readable. Use clip_to_grid to read existing clips as grids. Auto-detects drum vs melodic content.

## Device Parameters

get_device_parameters returns exact parameter names and min/max ranges. Use these names exactly — they are case-sensitive. Values outside min/max are silently clamped.

For batch changes, set_device_parameters (pass a JSON dict of name:value pairs) is 3-5x faster than repeated set_device_parameter calls. realtime_set_parameter sends via UDP (fire-and-forget, no confirmation) — use for live filter sweeps and real-time control.

VST/AU plugins expose only ~32 automatable parameters by default. Use get_plugin_info for guidance on Configure mode.

Hidden parameters (via M4L): addressed by parameter_index (int), not name. Index 0 ("Device On") is auto-skipped in batch operations for safety.

## Mixer

set_mixer unifies track/return/master control via the track_type parameter. Key ranges:
- volume: 0.0-1.0 (0.85 ≈ 0 dB, not 1.0)
- pan: -1.0 (L) to 1.0 (R). Master has no pan.

For Split Stereo panning, call set_panning_mode(mode=1) first, then set_split_stereo_pan for independent L/R control.

Routing: always call get_track_routing before set_track_routing — you need the exact display names from Ableton's available routing list.

## Automation

create_clip_automation writes envelopes inside session clips (time = beats from clip start). create_track_automation writes to arrangement timeline lanes (time = beats from song start). Do not confuse them — they target different contexts.

Use as few points as possible — Ableton interpolates linearly between breakpoints. A ramp needs only 2 points; a triangle needs 3. Points are auto-reduced if more than 20 are submitted.

create_automation_curve generates shaped envelopes (sine, exponential, s_curve, triangle, sawtooth, etc.). The cycles parameter is cycles per clip length, not per beat. create_step_automation creates held-value steps.

Automation values are in the parameter's native range (usually 0.0-1.0 normalized).

## Browser & Loading

load_instrument_or_effect resolves built-in Ableton device names directly — "Wavetable", "Operator", "Drift", "Compressor", "EQ Eight", etc. Use search_browser only when loading user presets, third-party plugins, or items whose exact name is unknown (results are instant via cached index). Call refresh_browser_cache after installing new packs.

When loading plugins onto tracks inside a group, always call set_track_fold(track_index, False) on the group track first to expand it. Ableton cannot load devices onto child tracks of a collapsed group via the Remote Script — the operation will silently fail or timeout.

## Creative Tools

Each generative tool (scale_constrained_generate, generate_chord_progression, generate_bass_line, harmonize_melody, quantize_to_scale) takes its own scale_name and root parameters. For consistency across a session, read get_song_scale first and pass its root_note and scale_name to each creative tool call.

Drum pattern tools (generate_euclidean_rhythm, generate_drum_pattern) use standard GM layout: kick=36, snare=38, hihat=42, open_hat=46. Use quantize_to_scale for post-hoc scale correction of melodic output.

## M4L Bridge

Check m4l_connected from get_server_capabilities before calling any M4L tool. If false, use standard get_device_parameters / set_device_parameter instead.

Key M4L subsystems:
- **Note surgery**: get_clip_notes_with_ids → modify_clip_notes / remove_clip_notes_by_id for in-place, non-destructive editing (Live 11+).
- **Snapshots**: snapshot_device_state captures all params. morph_between_snapshots interpolates between two snapshots (quantized params snap at the 0.5 midpoint). In-memory only — lost on server restart.
- **Observation**: observe_property → get_property_changes → stop_observing for event-driven monitoring (~10 ms latency).
- **Audio analysis**: analyze_track_audio — track_index -1 = M4L device track, -2 = master, 0+ = regular track.
- **AB compare**: device_ab_compare for preset comparison (Live 12.3+).

## Undo & Safety

Call end_undo_step after a sequence of operations to group them into a single undo action. Create/delete commands (tracks, clips, scenes, devices) are non-idempotent — do not retry on error.

Compound workflow tools are NOT atomic: partial failure (e.g., instrument fails to load) leaves partial state. Snapshots, macros, and parameter maps are in-memory only (lost on restart). Effect chain templates persist to disk.

## Input Constraints

- Notes: max 10,000 per call. Each note: {pitch, start_time, duration, velocity} — pitch 0-127, velocity 1-127, duration > 0, start_time ≥ 0.
- Automation: max 500 points per call (auto-reduced to preserve shape).
- Batch parameters: max 200 per call. Batch tracks: max 50.
- Time values throughout are in beats (1.0 = one quarter note).
