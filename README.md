# AbletonBridge

**359 tools connecting Claude AI to Ableton Live** (340 core + 19 optional ElevenLabs voice/SFX tools)

AbletonBridge gives Claude direct control over your Ableton Live session through the Model Context Protocol. Create tracks, write MIDI, design sounds, mix, automate, browse instruments, snapshot presets, and navigate deep into device chains and modulation matrices — all through natural language conversation.

## What It Can Do

**Music Creation** — *"Create a MIDI track, load Operator, and write an 8-bar bass line in E minor"* · *"Build a Metro-Boomin-style 808 beat using grid notation"* · *"Make a 4-bar jazz chord progression — Cm7, Fm7, Dm7b5, G7 — with voice leading"*

**Sound Design** — *"Load Wavetable and design a warm detuned supersaw pad"* · *"Snapshot the current preset, tweak it brighter, then morph back 50%"* · *"Set the Compressor side-chain input to the kick drum track"*

**Deep Device Access** (M4L) — *"Show me what's inside the Drum Rack — all chains and nested devices"* · *"Set Wavetable's LFO1 modulation to filter cutoff at 0.6"* · *"Analyze the full spectrum of track 5 using cross-track routing"*

**Mixing & Arrangement** — *"Create a filter sweep automation from 0.2 to 0.9 over 8 bars"* · *"Create a reverb return track and send drums to it at 30%"* · *"Get arrangement clips on all tracks and give me a structure overview"*

**Creative Generation** — *"Generate a Euclidean rhythm with 16 steps and 5 pulses"* · *"Write a I-vi-IV-V chord progression with drop2 voicings"* · *"Create a trap drum pattern, 2 bars, with swing"*

**Session Management** — *"Full overview of all tracks — names, devices, volumes"* · *"Search the browser for 'vocoder' and load it on the master track"* · *"Snapshot every device on tracks 0-3 as 'verse preset'"*

Claude AI  <--MCP-->  MCP Server  <--TCP:9877-->  Ableton Remote Script
                          |            <--UDP:9882-->  (real-time params)

MCP Server (modular architecture):
  server.py          — slim orchestrator (~300 lines)
  state.py           — centralized global state + locks
  constants.py       — command tiers, browser categories
  validation.py      — input validation + size limits
  connections/       — ableton.py (TCP), m4l.py (UDP/OSC)
  cache/             — browser.py (cache + disk persistence)
  dashboard/         — html.py, server.py (Starlette)
  tools/             — 15 modules (340 tools)
  prompts.py         — 4 MCP prompt templates
  instructions.py    — server instructions (cross-tool guidance)
```

- **Remote Script** (TCP+UDP) — runs inside Ableton as a Control Surface. TCP:9877 for commands, UDP:9882 for real-time parameter updates at 50+ Hz.
- **M4L Bridge** (UDP/OSC) — optional Audio Effect device for hidden parameters, rack chain internals, audio analysis, modulation matrices, event monitoring, and more.
- **ElevenLabs Server** (optional) — 19 tools for AI voice generation, sound effects, voice cloning. Requires `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`.
- **MCP Server Instructions** — cross-tool guidance injected into the AI's context on every connection. Covers workflow sequencing, compound tool preferences, M4L fallback logic, and input constraints.
- **MCP Resources** — `ableton://session`, `ableton://tracks`, `ableton://capabilities` for direct data access.
- **MCP Prompts** — guided workflows: `create-beat`, `mix-track`, `sound-design`, `arrange-section`.
- **Web Dashboard** — real-time status, tool metrics, and server logs at `http://127.0.0.1:9880`.

## Stability & Reliability

AbletonBridge is built to handle real-world sessions without crashing Ableton:

- **Chunked async LiveAPI** — large device discovery split into 4-param chunks with 50ms delays
- **Chunked response protocol** — large responses split, base64-encoded, reassembled automatically
- **URL-safe base64** — `A-Z a-z 0-9 - _` only; avoids Max OSC routing conflicts
- **Deferred processing** — all M4L outlets use `Task.schedule()` to avoid blocking audio/UI thread
- **LiveAPI cursor reuse** — `goto()` reuses 3 cursors instead of creating ~193 new instances
- **Fire-and-forget writes** — no post-set readback (the #1 crash pattern)
- **Command-specific timeouts** — per-command timeouts (e.g., freeze_track → 60s, load_instrument → 30s) instead of fixed 10s/15s
- **Socket drain** — clears stale UDP responses before each command
- **Singleton guard** — exclusive port lock prevents duplicate server instances
- **Disk-persisted cache** — 6,400+ browser items in gzip; instant startup (~50ms)
- **Auto-reconnect** — exponential backoff for TCP and UDP connections
- **Tiered command delays** — 3-tier system (0ms/10ms/20ms) eliminates unnecessary waits for property setters
- **Async tool handlers** — all tools run via `asyncio.to_thread()`, preventing sync I/O from blocking the event loop
- **Concurrency control** — async semaphore serializes tool dispatch; threading locks protect TCP and UDP sockets from corruption
- **Tool execution timeout** — 120s hard timeout prevents stuck tools from blocking the entire pipeline
- **Bounded thread pool** — explicit 8-worker limit prevents resource exhaustion during rapid tool call bursts
- **Standardized responses** — all 340 tools return consistent `tool_success()`/`tool_error()` JSON envelopes via decorator
- **Chunk reassembly hardening** — duplicate detection, progress logging, missing chunk index reporting
- **Parameter resolution cache** — 500-entry FIFO cache for brute-force display→value resolution (O(1) after first call)
- **Effect chain persistence** — saved templates survive server restarts via `~/.ableton-bridge/chain_templates.json`
- **214 tests** — 11 test files covering connections, M4L, cache, creative tools, workflows, and validation edge cases

## Flexibility

- **Any MCP client** — Claude Desktop, Cursor, Claude Code, or any MCP-compatible tool
- **300 tools without Max for Live** — full session control via TCP/UDP Remote Script; M4L is optional
- **+40 deep-access tools with M4L** — hidden parameters, rack internals, audio analysis, event monitoring
- **+19 optional ElevenLabs tools** — AI voice generation, sound effects, cloning, transcription
- **Ableton Live 10, 11, and 12** — graceful API fallbacks for version-specific features
- **Cross-platform** — Windows and macOS
- **Quick setup** — `uv run` for server, one folder for Remote Script, one M4L device for bridge

## Claude Cowork Plugin

A ready-to-install plugin for [Claude Cowork](https://claude.ai/cowork) is included in the `cowork-plugin/` directory. It wires up the AbletonBridge MCP server and provides four domain-specific skills so Claude knows how to use the tools effectively.

### Skills included

| Skill | Triggers | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| **Compose** | "create a beat", "write a melody", "add chords", "drum pattern", "bass line" | MIDI composition, creative generators, chord progressions, euclidean rhythms |
| **Mix** | "mix", "add reverb", "EQ", "sound design", "load an effect", "set volume" | Mixer levels, device loading, parameter control, effect chains, snapshots |
| **Session** | "play", "stop", "set tempo", "what tracks", "fire scene", "show me the session" | Transport, tracks, clips, scenes, browser navigation, recording |
| **Deep Control** | "hidden parameters", "rack chain", "M4L", "Wavetable modulation", "audio analysis" | M4L bridge tools, hidden params, rack chains, note surgery, property monitoring |

### Installation

1. Ensure AbletonBridge is installed and Ableton is running with the Remote Script active (see setup instructions below)
2. Open Cowork and drag `cowork-plugin/` onto the plugin drop zone, **or** zip the folder as `ableton-bridge.plugin` and open it:
   ```bash
   cd cowork-plugin && zip -r ../ableton-bridge.plugin . -x "*.DS_Store"
   ```
3. Accept the plugin in Cowork — the MCP server and all four skills will be available immediately
4. For M4L tools: drag `AbletonBridge` from User Library → Audio Effects → Max Audio Effect onto any audio track in your session
